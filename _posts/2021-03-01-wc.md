This page is to inform users that lightwalletd operators have not been served with a secret government subpoena in any of its hardware, its software, or its services. If a warrant canary has not been updated in the time period specified by us, users are to assume that we have indeed been served with a secret subpoena. The intention is to allow us to warn users of the existence of a subpoena passively, without disclosing to others that the government has sought or obtained access to information or records under a secret subpoena. Warrant canaries have been found to be legal by the United States Justice Department, so long as they are passive in their notifications.
